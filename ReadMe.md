# basicbooksapi

A REST API for managing books and authors, built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, as part of a hands-on backend Java learning project.

> **Note on AI use**: All the project code (entities, controllers, tests, Docker configuration, etc.) was written by hand. Only this README file was AI-generated.

## Project goal

This project serves as a sandbox to consolidate the fundamentals of a modern Java backend: from raw SQL to a containerized, tested, and documented API.

## Tech stack

- **Language**: Java 21
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 4.1 (Web, Data JPA)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
- **Migrations**: Flyway
- **Testing**: JUnit 5, MockMvc, Mockito
- **Observability**: Micrometer Tracing (Brave)
- **API Documentation**: springdoc-openapi (Swagger UI)
- **Build**: Maven
- **Containerization**: Docker (multi-stage build) + Docker Compose
- **Utilities**: Lombok, SLF4J

## Architecture

Organized by technical layer (`controller`, `entity`, `repository`, `dto`, `exception`), which fits the current size of the project.

├── repository/       # Spring Data JPA interfaces

│   └── response/       # Response DTOs (e.g. BookResponse)

```

## Data model

Two entities linked by a `@ManyToOne` / implicit `@OneToMany` relationship:

- **Author**: `id`, `name` (unique), `country`
- **Book**: `id`, `title`, `year`, `author` (reference to `Author`)

The schema is fully version-controlled through Flyway migrations (`src/main/resources/db/migration`).

## Endpoints

### Authors

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                          |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/authors`         | List all authors                      |
| GET    | `/api/authors/{id}`    | Get an author by id                   |
| POST   | `/api/authors`         | Create an author                      |
| PUT    | `/api/authors/{id}`    | Update an author                      |
| DELETE | `/api/authors/{id}`    | Delete an author                      |

### Books

| Method | Endpoint           | Description                                        |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/books`         | List all books (author flattened in response)        |
| GET    | `/api/books/{id}`    | Get a book by id                                     |
| POST   | `/api/books`         | Create a book (references the author via `authorId`) |
| PUT    | `/api/books/{id}`    | Update a book                                        |
| DELETE | `/api/books/{id}`    | Delete a book                                        |

### Error handling

Centralized through a global `@ControllerAdvice`:

| Code | Case                                              |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 404  | Resource not found (author, book)                    |
| 409  | Conflict (e.g. author name already exists)            |
| 400  | Invalid request                                       |

## API Documentation (Swagger / OpenAPI)

The API is documented using [springdoc-openapi](https://springdoc.org/), which generates an OpenAPI specification directly from the Spring MVC controllers and exposes it through Swagger UI.

Once the application is running, the documentation is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html   # Interactive UI
http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs       # Raw OpenAPI spec (JSON)
```

Documentation coverage:

- Global API metadata (title, description, version) configured in `OpenApiConfig`.
- `AuthorController` endpoints are fully annotated (`@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@Parameter`) as a reference example, including documented success and error responses (`text/plain` content for error messages returned by the `@ControllerAdvice`).
- Request/response DTOs (`BookRequest`, `BookResponse`) and the `Author` entity are annotated with `@Schema` to describe each field, with examples.
- Controllers explicitly declare `produces = "application/json"` so Swagger UI reflects the actual response content type instead of the generic `*/*` default.

## Running the project

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Java 21 (for running outside a container)

### With Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust values if needed:
```bash
   cp .env.example .env
```
2. Start everything (API + database):
```bash
   docker compose up --build
```
3. The API is available at `http://localhost:8080`.

Flyway migrations run automatically on startup.

### Locally, without Docker

1. Start a PostgreSQL instance accessible locally.
2. Adjust `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or the corresponding environment variables) with your connection details.
3. Run the application:
```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Tests

Web-layer integration tests (`@WebMvcTest` + Mockito) on both controllers, covering both happy paths and error cases (resource not found, duplicate, invalid reference).

```bash
./mvnw test
```

## Notable technical points

- **Multi-stage Docker build**: lightweight final image (JRE only), without the Maven build tooling.
- **Externalized configuration**: database credentials passed through environment variables (`.env`, not committed), no sensitive values in the repository.
- **PostgreSQL healthcheck**: the API service waits for the database to actually be ready (`pg_isready`) before starting, not just for the container to exist.
- **Dedicated DTOs**: separation between the persistence model (JPA entities) and the exposed API contract, avoiding internal structure leaks and serialization cycles.
- **Tracing**: trace/span identifiers automatically injected into logs, in preparation for a future multi-service architecture.
- **Interactive API documentation**: OpenAPI spec and Swagger UI generated directly from the codebase, kept in sync with the actual controller behavior.
